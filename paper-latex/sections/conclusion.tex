\section{Conclusion}
We present a novel approach for assessing pronunciation errors in Holy Quran learners through a multi-level Quran Phonetic Script that captures all pronunciation errors for \textit{Hafs} (except \texttt{Ishmam}, as it is a visual diacritic not orally produced). We provide 890 hours of annotated audio data with 300K samples, a 98\%-efficient pipeline for generating similar datasets, and a novel multi-level CTC model. Achieving a 0.16\% average phoneme error rate on unseen test data proves the learnability of the Quran Phonetic Script, fundamentally transforming Holy Quran pronunciation assessment methodology.
