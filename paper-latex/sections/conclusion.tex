\section{Conclusion}
We present a novel approach for assessing pronunciation errors in Holy Quran learners through a multi-level Quran Phonetic Script that captures all pronunciation errors for \textit{Hafs} (except \texttt{Ishmam}, as it is a visual diacritic not orally produced). We provide 850+ hours of annotated audio data with $\sim$300K samples, a 98\% automated pipeline for generating similar datasets featuring our Tasmeea verification algorithm, and a novel multi-level CTC model with an 11-level structure (1 phoneme level + 10 sifat levels). Achieving a 0.21\% average phoneme error rate on unseen expert test data proves the learnability of the Quran Phonetic Script. Furthermore, our model demonstrates robust generalization on real learner errors through qdat\_bench, achieving 75.8\% Tajweed F1 score and 84.7\% accuracy on female reciters, fundamentally transforming Holy Quran pronunciation assessment methodology.
