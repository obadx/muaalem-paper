\section{Limitations and Future Work}
A big limitation appears from attribute-specific articulation patterns: Certain attributes apply exclusively to individual letters, such as \texttt{Istitala} for (ض) and \texttt{Tikrar} for (ر). Consequently, we expect our model will be unable to capture instances of (ض) without \texttt{Istitala} or (ر) without \texttt{Tikrar}. This limitation similarly applies to Tajweed rules that occur less frequently in the Holy Quran, such as \texttt{Imala}, \texttt{Rawm}, and \texttt{Tasheel}. The obious solution is to annotate real data with these errors to make the model understand better these errors.
