\section{Limitations and Future Work}
Our primary limitation is that our dataset consists of golden recitations with no errors, limiting our ability to evaluate performance on real-world data. Although we tested on a few actual samples and successfully detected \textit{madd}, \textit{ghunnah}, and \textit{qalqalah} errors, we need to develop a comprehensive dataset containing error-containing recitations transcribed with our Quran Phonetic Script.  

A secondary limitation arises from attribute-specific articulation patterns: Certain attributes apply exclusively to individual letters, such as \texttt{Istitala} for (ض) and \texttt{Tikrar} for (ر). Consequently, we expect our model will be unable to capture instances of (ض) without \texttt{Istitala} or (ر) without \texttt{Tikrar}. This limitation similarly applies to Tajweed rules that occur less frequently in the Holy Quran, such as \texttt{Imala}, \texttt{Rawm}, and \texttt{Tasheel}.
