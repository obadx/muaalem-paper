\section{Results}
We trained on all Mushaf provided above, reserving Mushaf 26.1 and 19.0 for testing. The evaluation results are presented in Table~\ref{tab:results}. We notice that the Average Phoneme Error Rate is \textbf{0.21\%}, which proves our idea that the Quran Phonetics Script can be learned.

To evaluate our model's performance on real recitation errors, we tested on the qdat\_bench benchmark. The results, shown in Table~\ref{tab:qdat_bench}, demonstrate that despite being trained exclusively on expert male reciters, our model achieves remarkable performance on female recitations (120 samples) and overall error detection.

Notably, despite being trained exclusively on male expert reciters, our model demonstrates strong generalization capability by achieving 75.8\% Tajweed F1 score and 84.7\% accuracy on female recitations in qdat\_bench, highlighting the robustness of our approach for real-world deployment where diverse learner populations are expected. This performance on authentic learner mistakes validates the practical applicability of our Quranic phonetic script and multi-level CTC architecture.

We note that the PER across nearly all levels is balanced, except for the phoneme level, as it has a much larger vocabulary of 44 (with padding).
