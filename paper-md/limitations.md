# Limitations and Feature Wrok


Our first clear note that our data consits of golden recitations with no erros so we have no ability to jduge our work in real word data. Alought we tested it on few actuall samples and worked to dtect madd, ghonna and qalqla erros. we need to deveop full comprhensive dataset consits of recitations with errors transcripted with our Quran Phonetic script.

From the first point comes the secnod some attributtion of articulations are for single letters like `Istitala` for letter (ض) and `Tikrara` for letter (ر) so we except that our model want bet able to capute letter () without `Istitala` or letter (ر) without `Tikrar` and the same applies for tajweed rules that happends less ferquet in the Holy Quran like `Imala`, `Rawm`,  and `Tasheel`
