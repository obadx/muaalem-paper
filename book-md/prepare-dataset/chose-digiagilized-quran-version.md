## Choose a Digitized Version of the Holy Quran  

The Quran has multiple digitized versions including [Tanzil](https://tanzil.net) and [King Fahd Complex](https://qurancomplex.gov.sa). We chose Tanzil because:  
* It uses standard Unicode characters  
* Contains both *Imlaei* and *Uthmani* versions  
* Maintains high accuracy  

We excluded KFGQPC due to its evolving/unstable nature compared to Tanzil.
