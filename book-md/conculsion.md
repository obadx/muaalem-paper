# Conclusion  

We present a new way of assessing pronunciation errors of Holy Quran learners by developing multi-level Quran Phonetic Script capable of capturing all pronunciation errors for *Hafs* except for `Ishmam` (as it is a sign not pronounced by mouth), along with 890 hours and 300K of annotated data, a 98% pipeline to create similar data, plus modeling and validation.
